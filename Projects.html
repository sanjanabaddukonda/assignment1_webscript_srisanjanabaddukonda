                   <p>In this project, I explored the issue of fast fashion and how it harms the environment. This was done for my Management of the 
                    enterprise course to further understand what sort of managerial decisions can be taken to overcome a wasteful industry. This video includes animation, graphics, music and more. It also covers
                    the 20 sustainable goals.</p>

                    <p>Fast fashion refers to low-cost, fashionable, mass-produced clothing that has a significant negative environmental impact. Customers are drawn to these clothes because they are stylish and reasonably priced. These garments, however, are swiftly abandoned and accumulate in landfills because they aren't made to last and quickly go out of fashion.</p>

                <p> In this assignment I deep dived into the Atari console. This video goes in depth into it's architecture and more. The atari 2600 is one of the best selling consoles of all time. It's architecture was a huge accomplishment and was worthwile learning more about.</p>
                <p>Compared to the original systems, the Atari 2600 boasted better games, more vibrant visuals, and crisper sound. The ability to switch games by adding new cartridges was crucial. Children enjoyed playing Frogger, Combat, Space Invaders, Pac-Man, and outrunning ghosts while defending the world from alien invasion.</p>

                 <p>In this assignment I went over the basics of marketing. I went over topics such as what marketing is, how it's used, examples of business that are good or bad at marketing and much more.</p>
                 <p>The benefit of marketing for your company is that it engages consumers and helps them decide whether to purchase your goods or services. A marketing strategy, which is a component of your business plan, also aids in establishing and sustaining demand, relevance, reputation, competition, etc.</p>
